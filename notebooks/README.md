# Notebooks

This folder contains all the Jupyter notebooks used for the analysis, experimentation, and optimization of Bollinger Bands strategies. Each notebook addresses different aspects of the project, such as execution delay testing, grid search optimization, and manual documentation of procedures.

## Description of the notebooks

- **execution_delay_test.ipynb**: Analyzes and measures the impact of order execution delay on the strategy's performance. Useful for evaluating the robustness of the strategy under realistic market conditions.

- **grid_search_optimization.ipynb**: Performs a grid search to optimize the parameters of the Bollinger Bands. Allows identification of parameter combinations that maximize the strategy's performance.

- **manual.ipynb**: Provides a detailed guide to using the notebooks and the main functions of the project. Includes practical examples and step-by-step explanations to help even those new to the code.

- **mkt orders.ipynb**: Explores the management and execution of market orders within the strategy. Analyzes the differences between market orders and other types of orders, with practical examples.

In this folder you will also find the results of the analyses and the logs generated during the various experiments.
