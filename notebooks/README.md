# Notebooks

This folder contains all Jupyter notebooks for the analysis, experimentation, and optimization of Bollinger Bands trading strategies. Each notebook addresses a specific aspect of the project, from parameter optimization to execution analysis, order handling, and practical usage.

## Notebook Descriptions

- **Asset_Explore.ipynb**: Explores and visualizes asset data, providing insights into price behavior and volatility before strategy development.

- **execution_delay_test.ipynb**: Evaluates the effect of order execution delays on strategy performance, simulating realistic market conditions to assess robustness and slippage impact.

- **grid_search_optimization.ipynb**: Performs a comprehensive grid search to optimize Bollinger Bands parameters, identifying the best-performing parameter sets for the strategy.

- **manual.ipynb**: User guide for the project, with detailed instructions, practical examples, and explanations of main functions and workflows.

- **mkt orders.ipynb**: Investigates the handling and execution of market orders, comparing them to other order types with hands-on examples and performance analysis.

- **spread_comparison.ipynb**: Analyzes the impact of bid-ask spread on trading performance, comparing strategy results with and without spread costs.

- **tick_backtest.ipynb**: Runs tick-level backtests of the Bollinger Bands strategy, enabling high-resolution performance evaluation and slippage analysis.

Additional results and logs generated during experiments can also be found in this folder, supporting further analysis and reproducibility.
